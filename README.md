# June 2023 - UC Berkeley Full Stack Coding Boot Camp

## Class Content Repo

This is the class content repo and will contain the activites and homework assignment instructions for each module. Each week, new content will be posted here. Before each module, open a terminal in this repo and enter `git pull origin main` to get the latest content including `solved` folders from the previous modules activities.

## Working on activities and homework challenges

Before working on any activity or homework assignment in this repo, copy the folder to some other location in your file system. You do not want to modify files directly in this folder as it may make it difficult to pull updates.

Since this is a repo the instructional staff will use to deliver content to you, you should only do `git pull` operations here. To push up content for evaluation, like homework assignments, create a repo in GitHub and push your code there.
